Description: A statistical method for deconvolving expression data of mixed cancer tissues. It address two challenges: 1. estimation of both tumor proportion and tumor-specific expression, when neither is known a priori, 2. estimation of individualized expression profiles for both tumor and stromal tissues. We develop a three-component deconvolution model, DeMixT, for expression data from a mixture of cancerous tissues, infiltrating immune cells and tumor microenvironment. DeMixT is a frequentist-based method and fast in yielding accurate estimates of cell proportions and compartment-specific expression profiles for two-component and three-component deconvolution problem. Our method promises to provide deeper insight into cancer biomarkers and assist in the development of novel prognostic markers and therapeutic strategies.
